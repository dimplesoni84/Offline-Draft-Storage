Prompt:
You work at a social networking company and noticed users keep losing their posts when wifi cuts out or their phone loses signal - it's becoming a real problem that's making people frustrated. Create a React component using TypeScript for the Offline Draft Storage topic that saves what users are typing (posts, comments) directly in their browser using IndexedDB, checks if they're connected to the internet, and take a confirmation to uploads their saved drafts once they're back online. Make sure it shows users when their drafts get recovered and handles basic text content. Build this as one TypeScript file with React hooks, proper type definitions, and simple instructions for how to use it in a project. Make sure to provide everything in a single TypeScript file.
